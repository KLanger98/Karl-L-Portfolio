# <Karl's Portfolio>

## Description
Welcome to the repository of my portfolio website. The motivation behind this portfolio was to create a new portfolio showing off what I have learnt to create with React and display my creativity towards Web Development. I was lucky enough to source most of the doodles from Andreans D. Escobar's Notion Illustrations on Figma which inspired alot of my portfolio's design (Please find a link to Andrean's work below). By accessing the below live link you will find a list of some projects I am proud of, a summary of myself and my skills along with some methods to contact me.
